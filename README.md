### My comments

To release reserved tickets after 15 minutes if not purchased, on server should be added crone job, set to run every minute and call `ReleaseReservedTicketsJob`

I dont create validations in `Ticket` model becouse I did it in `CreateTicketForm` (I want to keep it dry and only available access from api to tickets is by create method)

I dont raise errors if tickes or events are empty arrays, in my opinion it's not error or exception, and it's ok to return empty array.

I tried to not change too much in prepared structure, I only change these code that I thik was most important
